		<h3>Who are you?</h3>

		<p>I'm an Asian American New Yorker who can't seem to live anywhere else in the world. 

		<br>
		Live in New York most of my life and frew up in southern Brooklyn before Brooklyn was a desired place to live in.  </p>

		<h3>Wait, what?</h3>
		<p>Just a normal guy looking to learn more about coding to help enhance my career.  I'm an advertising guy that has been in the ad industry for far too long than I've expected. 

		Ask me anything about digital advertising.
